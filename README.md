# Progressive Mine Sweep

This is my progressive / incremental take on the classic minesweeper game

The user should start with a small and simple version of minesweep (3x3 with 1 mine?)

There will be 2 scores tracked: number of correct cells, and number of solved puzzles

(internally, we can track clicks, fails, mines, and auto vs manual version of all of these)

Progressive elements can be unlocked by using these scores: increase width, height,
number of mines, score per cell/puzzle, etc.

Automated aspects can be gradually introduced: Auto expand empty cells, logic reasoning for cells,
advancing it, making automation faster, auto mine marker, and guesser

Perhaps I could do prestige/reset options once this is ready
